**Bundled Assets:** A single Vite build fingerprints the js/css into docs/assets/ so Plotly and helpers load once per session across every page. Source modules stay human-readable in src/ (search.js, ministries.js, ministers.js, language.js).

**Deployment Note:** GitHub Pages serves the bundled assets above, keeping all six pages routable so every chart, narrative, and dataset remains visible.

**Progressive Loading:** Each page boots with a <=200 KB summary payload and surfaces a "Load full dataset" control that fetches extra JSON shards from docs/data/ on demand. Every insight documented below stays reachable once a visitor opts in.

**Search Archives:** Search opens with docs/data/search-index/overview.json for instant answers. Choosing "Expand to 40,000 sentences" streams decade/topic shards so power users can still roam the entire corpus in-browser without penalising casual readers.

• 15 ministry classifications
• 7 linguistic metrics
• 4 crisis periods examined

Processing Pipeline:
Raw PDF → Markdown → Sentence Parsing → Classification → Analysis
```

#### C. Methodology

**1. Ministry Topic Classification**
```
Approach: Weighted keyword matching

Each ministry has 10-30 keywords (e.g., Defence: "defence", 
"military", "saf", "national service")

Multi-word keywords get higher weights:
• "national service" = 2 points
• "defence" = 1 point

Sentence assigned to ministry with highest score.
Sentences with no clear match = "general"

Accuracy: 82.7% of sentences classified to specific ministries
```

**2. Linguistic Analysis**
```
Metrics Calculated:
• Flesch Reading Ease Score
  Formula: 206.835 - 1.015(words/sentence) - 84.6(syllables/word)
  
• Average sentence length (words)
• Average word complexity (syllables)
• Vocabulary diversity (unique words per 100 words)
• Formality score (frequency of formal markers)
```

**3. Crisis Analysis**
```
4 Major Crises Examined:
• 1985 Recession
• 1997 Asian Financial Crisis
• 2008 Global Financial Crisis
• 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic

Method: Compare ministry distribution in 3-year windows:
• Before (3 years prior)
• During (crisis period)
• After (3 years post)
```

## Design System

### Minimalist Aesthetic

**Philosophy:** Let the data story shine, not the design.

### Color Palette

```css
:root {
  /* Primary Colors */
  --primary: #2E86AB;        /* Singapore blue */
  --secondary: #A23B72;      /* Accent purple */
  --success: #6A994E;        /* Green for positive */
  --warning: #F77F00;        /* Orange for attention */
  --danger: #E63946;         /* Red for decline */
  
  /* Neutral Palette */
  --text: #1a1a1a;           /* Near-black text */
  --text-muted: #666;        /* Secondary text */
  --bg: #ffffff;             /* White background */
  --bg-gray: #f8f9fa;        /* Light gray panels */
  --border: #e0e0e0;         /* Subtle borders */
  
  /* Ministry Colors (from notebook) */
  --ministry-defence: #5F0F40;
  --ministry-finance: #2E86AB;
  --ministry-education: #C73E1D;
  --ministry-manpower: #F18F01;
  --ministry-health: #6A994E;
  /* ... all 15 ministries */
}
```

### Typography

```css
:root {
  /* Font Stack */

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- CSS3 (custom properties, grid, flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Plotly.js (interactive charts)

**No Frameworks:** Keep it simple, fast, and maintainable.

**Why No React/Vue/etc?**
- Static data (no real-time updates)
- Better performance (no bundle overhead)
- Easier for future contributors
- GitHub Pages compatibility

---

### JavaScript Architecture

**1. Search Engine (search.js)**

```javascript
// Progressive search loading
let overviewData = [];
const shardCache = new Map();

async function ensureOverviewLoaded() {
  if (overviewData.length) return overviewData;
  const response = await fetch('data/search-index/overview.json');
  overviewData = await response.json();
  console.log(`Loaded ${overviewData.length} overview sentences`);
  return overviewData;
}

async function ensureShardLoaded(type, key) {
  const cacheKey = `${type}:${key}`;
  if (shardCache.has(cacheKey)) {
    return shardCache.get(cacheKey);
  }

  const response = await fetch(`data/search-index/${type}/${key}.json`);
  const data = await response.json();
  shardCache.set(cacheKey, data);
  console.log(`Loaded ${data.length} sentences for ${cacheKey}`);
  return data;
}

async function getSearchDataset(scope) {
  if (!scope || scope.type === 'overview') {
    return ensureOverviewLoaded();
  }
  return ensureShardLoaded(scope.type, scope.key);
}

async function performSearch(query, filters, scope) {
  let results = await getSearchDataset(scope);

  if (query) {
    const lowerQuery = query.toLowerCase();
    results = results.filter(item =>
      item.sentence.toLowerCase().includes(lowerQuery)
    );
  }

  if (filters.year) {
    results = results.filter(item => item.year === filters.year);
  }

  if (filters.minister) {
    results = results.filter(item => item.minister === filters.minister);
  }

  if (filters.ministry) {
    results = results.filter(item => item.ministry === filters.ministry);
  }

  const limit = scope && scope.type !== 'overview' ? 200 : 60;
  return results.slice(0, limit);
}

// Highlight matching text
function highlightText(text, query) {
  if (!query) return text;
  const regex = new RegExp(`(${query})`, 'gi');
  return text.replace(regex, '<mark>$1</mark>');
}
```

UI flow:
- On page load call `ensureOverviewLoaded()` so the first 60 answers appear instantly.
- Tapping "Expand to full archive" invokes `ensureShardLoaded('decades', decade)` or `ensureShardLoaded('topics', topic)` and refreshes results with the 200-result cap.
- We keep the overview data in memory; shards live in `shardCache` so subsequent toggles reuse the previously downloaded files.

**2. Chart Rendering (language.js, ministries.js, ministers.js)**

```javascript
// Plotly.js chart configuration
function renderReadabilityChart(data) {
  const trace = {
    x: data.map(d => d.year),
    y: data.map(d => d.flesch_score),
    type: 'scatter',
    mode: 'lines+markers',
    name: 'Flesch Score',
    line: { color: '#2E86AB', width: 3 },
    marker: { size: 6 }
  };
  
  const layout = {
    title: 'Reading Ease Over Time',
    xaxis: { title: 'Year' },
    yaxis: { title: 'Flesch Score (Higher = Easier)' },
    hovermode: 'closest',
    font: { family: 'system-ui, sans-serif' }
  };
  
  Plotly.newPlot('readability-chart', [trace], layout, {
    responsive: true,
    displayModeBar: false
  });
}
```

**3. Progressive Statistics Loading**

```javascript
// Load statistics on demand
async function loadMinistryStats(ministry) {
  const statsPanel = document.getElementById(`stats-${ministry}`);
  
  if (statsPanel.dataset.loaded) return; // Already loaded
  
  const response = await fetch(`data/ministry_${ministry}.json`);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Render statistics
  statsPanel.innerHTML = renderStatsTable(data);
  statsPanel.dataset.loaded = 'true';
}

// Attach to details elements
document.querySelectorAll('.stats-panel').forEach(panel => {
  panel.addEventListener('toggle', function() {
    if (this.open) {
      const ministry = this.dataset.ministry;
      loadMinistryStats(ministry);
    }
  });
});
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

### Deployment Strategy: `docs/` Folder Method

**Why `docs/` folder?**
- Keeps website separate from analysis code
- No need for separate `gh-pages` branch
- Easier to maintain and update

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Prepare docs/ for build outputs
mkdir -p docs/{assets,data}

# 2. Build hashed assets with Vite (outputs to docs/assets/)
npm install
npm run build

# 3. Run data export script (see next section)
cd analysis
python export_for_web.py
cd ..

# 4. Move/refresh HTML entry files
cp *.html docs/

# 5. Commit and push
git add docs/
git commit -m "Add website to docs/ for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main

# 6. Enable GitHub Pages
# Go to: github.com/jeremychia/singapore-budget-speeches/settings/pages
# Source: main branch
# Folder: /docs
# Save

# 7. Wait 1-2 minutes, then visit:
# https://jeremychia.github.io/singapore-budget-speeches/
```

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Use Python's built-in server
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000

# Visit: http://localhost:8000
```

This simulates GitHub Pages and catches issues like:
- Incorrect file paths
- Missing data files
- JavaScript errors
